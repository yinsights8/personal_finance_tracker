description: Seed realistic dummy expenses for a specific user 
argument-hint: "<user_id> <count> <months>"
allowed-tools: Read, Bash(python3:*)
---

Read Database/db.py to understand the expense table schema, the db connection pattern, and the database file name. 

User input:  
## Step 1 - Parse arguments 

Extract the $ARGUMENTS: 
- user_id - integer
- count - integer, number of expenses to create
- months - integer, how many past moths to spread them across

if any argument is missing or not a valid integer, stop and say: 
"Usage: /seed-expenses <user_id> <count> <months>
Example: /seed-expenses 1 50 6"

## Step 2 - Generate and insert expences 

Write and run a Python script that: 

1. Spread expenses randomly across the past <months> months
2. Uses these categories with realistic descriptions and amount (GBP, INR, etc)
- Food: 10-800
- Bill: 50-500
- Transport: 5-100
- Health: 100- 5000
- Entertenment: 0-300
- Shopping: 10-1000
- others: 50-1000
3. Distribute the categories roughly proportionally (Food most common, Health and Entertainment least)
4. Uses the db connection pattern from db.py - do not hardcode the database filename
5. Uses parameterised queries only - no string formatting in SQL
6. Insert all expenses in a single transaction - roll back everything if any insert fails

## Step 4 - Confirm

Print: 
- How many expenses were inserted
- The date range they span 
- A sample of 5 inserted records
